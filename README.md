# PHP image 

Basic php image with composer installed and xdebug installed but disabled.

## Goal and content motivation

library/php is great, but not enough. Almost every php project uses composer, as it
became standard to create php packages. And we often use xdebug while develop, so
it is included. So it includes latest composer and latest xdebug available at
moment of build.
