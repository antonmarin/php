# PHP image 

Basic php image with composer installed and xdebug installed but disabled.

## Goal and content motivation

library/php is great, but not enough. Almost every php project uses composer, as it
became standard to create php packages. And we often use xdebug while develop, so
it is included. 

This is combination of php-xdebug and php-composer(https://hub.docker.com/r/antonmarin/php-composer)
and my base image for php projects.
